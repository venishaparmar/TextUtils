# TextUtils
I have built TextUtils as a learning of ReactJS and to practice my front-end development skills. The app includes features such as changing text to uppercase or lowercase, clearing text, copying text, removing extra spaces, and changing the theme between light and dark mode.

I am proud of the way the app turned out, and I believe it is a valuable tool for anyone who needs to work with text. I am currently working on adding additional features to TextUtils, such as the ability to search for text within the app and to export the results of text analysis. I am also planning to make the app available on mobile devices.
