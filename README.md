# TextUtils
I have built TextUtils as a learning of ReactJS and to practice my front-end development skills. The app includes features such as changing text to uppercase or lowercase, clearing text, copying text, removing extra spaces, and changing the theme between light and dark mode.

Here I have attached a short video which demonstrates this TextUtils App.
